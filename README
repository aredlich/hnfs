# hnfs - Haskell bindings to libnfs  https://github.com/aredlich/hnfs

## Overview

### Library

Hnfs provides Haskell bindings to the libnfs C library which is developed at
 https://github.com/sahlberg/libnfs .
These bindings use the c2hs tool were first and foremost created as an exercise in
learning Haskell. The interface is not yet considered as stable (see TODO).
Neither is the code - use at your own risk.

Hnfs exposes both the synchronous and the asynchronous interface of libnfs but
eschews its "raw" API. The nfs_url API is also omitted for the time being.

### hnfs-tester

Hnfs comes with hnfs-tester, a test tool based on Tasty to exercise the code
against an existing NFS export.

  Usage: hnfs-tester --server 127.0.0.1 --export /srv/test/

hnfs-tester *SHOULD NOT* be run against an NFS export that is used in production as
it could lead to data loss.

## Installation Notes

* Get libnfs from https://github.com/aredlich/libnfs as it
  contains a few modifications which are not pushed upstream yet.
* Get the haskell libraries listed in hnfs.cabal's build-depends of the library and
  the test tool. The version numbers listed in hnfs.cabal are based on the system
  hnfs is developed on; older versions might work as well - YMMV.

## Known Issues

* The asynchronous tests sporadically fail / hang

## TODO

* Investigate and fix spurious hangs / failures of the asynchronous tests
* Documentation
* Revisit error handling - use exceptions instead of / together with Either?
* Support for conduits
* More tests
* Split up into Nfs.Base, Nfs.Sync and Nfs.Async?
